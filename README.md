# Overview:
DSS-Track allows users to compare rows within Excel/CSV spreadsheets to identify items with significant semantic similarity (i.e. similar "meaning"). It tracks deep semantic similarity between uploaded rows, using a lightweight sentence-transformer model for encoding, to generate semantic embeddings. These semantic embeddings are then compared within the vector space via cosine similarity to identify possible duplicates.
